# ToDoList
This is a todo list in a console application that works with parallel arrays (if you can call them that).
It was a project for school. One of our very first ones actually. At that time we were learning about arrays, so this came in handy.

#### Note:
Please note that the project isn't fully polished and finished. This is quite a bit of code, I didn't really clean it up at all yet. ðŸ˜…
The namespace and the class also isn't a fitting one. ðŸ™ƒ  
Also, there's now another repository with the object oriented version of it on my GitHub! Make sure to check that one out as well! ðŸ˜‰
